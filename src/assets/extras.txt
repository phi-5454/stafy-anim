## The canonical ensemble

## A historical perspective

## Ultraviolet catastrophe
It is said that

## Why not a Poisson distribution?
This has to do with the fact that the quanta at hand are indistinguishable. I.e. the configuration 3|0|0 is equally likely as 3|1|1.

## The physical basis

What you see above is a simplified [Einstein solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_solid).

# The Boltzmann distribution
This simulation aims to illustrate a simple result: A Boltzmann distribution arises
from a purely combinatorial basis, when our system is similar enough to a system of a canonical ensemble.

It plays a fundameltal role in thermal physics.

In words, the distribution arises from purely combinatorial

Its domain of validity.

Of course, it is not the be-all-end-all of thermal distributions. You will come to learn of the conditions where the Boltzmann distribution breaks down, and of models that more accurately describe these cases, such as the **Fermi-Dirac** and **Bose-Einstein** distributions for dense, low temperature gases.

Note that when the density of the quanta becomes high, the distribution no longer converges to Boltzmann. In our case, a more apt description would be given by Bose-Einstein.

## Try the limits
At this limit, our system behaves in accordance to a **canonical ensemble**.

### A lesson in combinatorics
It seems that no matter how many energy quanta we have, the ground state is always the likeliest. Why is this?
Why is it the case, that the ground state is the likeliest?

We could ask the question: Given a single cell, how many quanta should we give it to maximize the number of ways we can distribute the rest of the quanta to the other cells? Here, we only need choose one number, the number of quanta to set on the cell, that is to say, we "fix" one degree of freedom regardless of what choice we make.

If we choose 0, we can choose any of the remaining cells for any given energy quantum. When selecting one or more, however, the number of quanta for which we make this choice will be smaller, in turn, yielding a smaller number of ways we can distribute them. \
We say that the choice of 0 quanta **maximizes the multiplicity** of the system.

### Degrees of freedom
In general, a degree of freedom corresponds to a choice that one could make when configuring a physical system. The term is well-applicable in the microformalism of state, as the "choices" we can make directly correspond to the properties of single particles (in this case, the positions of the quanta).
